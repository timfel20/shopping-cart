This is an e-commerce website with an option to create series of cards(in this case I refered to them as Products) 
and add them to a cart(Order). User can delete as much Products(OrderItems) from their cart and add as much as possible. 
Also, User can modify the the quantity of each Product(OrderItem) they have in their cart(Order). This project
has session and manager(CartManager) to facilitate the understandity and clarity of the code and save the sassion of products in the cart.

The template was made with twig. 

And in general, the project was made with love.
